---Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The requirements are Android Pie or newer. The goals were to create an inventory app that a user can use to add, edit, and delete inventory items. The user needs
the app was designed to address was the need to track and control inventory.

---What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The screens needed were a login screen, user account registration screen, inventory list screen, item edit screen, add item screen, and sms notification screen. My UI design was 
kept simple in order to not distract or confuse the user, and I feel that this was susccessful.

---How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

My approach was referencing the zybook material and lots of googling to see existing examples so that I could adapt the framework of an app into my own. This was the only way I could compelte
the task as I am unfamiliar with Android development and coding from scratch is outside my area of knowledge. But this approach could easily be applied in the future to any app I may want to
develop. 

---How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

I basically unit tested each piece as I went to make sure things were working, and as everything came together I did integration testing to make sure it all worked togehter.

---Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

In order to attempt to create something visually engaging I had to get creative with fonts and colors.

---In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

Probably the login screen.
